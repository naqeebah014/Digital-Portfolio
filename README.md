### Reflection:
I completed a task which focused on creating a CV and then took a quiz to test my understanding of the key components needed in a CV. 

My goal was to improve the CV I already had and make it better. My goal was also to understand the importand components that a CV needs and then apply this to improve my CV by reviewing and making changes to my CV.

I took about 25 to 30 minutes to reveiw my CV and checked which necessary sections was not on my CV and removing any irrelevant information from it. I then evaluated which important information was needed and checked if it was already there, if not, I added it.

Creating a CV, and then answering questions about its purpose, content and structure made me realize that the CV I initially had needed so much upgrades made to it. This task helped me in understanding what was lacking from my CV and how to to successfully upgrade it to meet the requirements an attractive CV.

### Evidence:

### Reflection:
I completed an Interview Skills task which covered key concepts such as the Context Action Result (CAR) method and how to answer common intervew questions. As someone who has never attended a formal job interview before, this task was valuable preparatiopn. I also did a mock interview which gave me some practical experience but it felt somewhat awkward when I had to "sell myself".

My goal was to understand the purpose of a job interview and learn how to use the CAR method to answer the interview questions. My goal was also to understand why doing reserarch on a company matters before an interview. My ultimate goal was to understand how to apply these skills in an interview despite feeling a bit uncomfortable with self promotion.

I went over interview best practices which includes how to frame answers making use of the CAR method. I also consulted someone who has went for many interview before (my mom) on what kind of questions is asked during interviews and how to answer these questions. When I did the mock interview I found it a bit cringe to talk about myself. I struggled with making the delivery sound natural but applied the CAR method to structure my answers better and to sound more authentic and not rehersed.

Doing the Interview Skills task and Mock Interview video has been an eye opening experience that has highlighted both my strengths and areas for growth. Although i felt uncormfortable at first, these tasks gave me important insight into interview procress.
