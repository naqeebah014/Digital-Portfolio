### Reflection:
I completed a Career Development task which focused on the fundamentals of career planning and setting goals.

My goal was to understand what the purpose of career counseling is and how to create a career development plan that aligned with the SMART goal framework. To understand the difference between soft skills and hard skills was also my goal.

I spent time reading and understanding the task which emphasized self-assessment such as interests, skills and values. I also applied the SMART framework to some draft career goals. I then prepared for the quiz.

As a result I got 100% on the quiz which shows my understanding on the main concepts taught in the task. I also found out that career counseling aims at exploring options and not just securing immediate jobs. Since completing this task I now use the SMART framework to break down my steps and pace myself.

### Reflection:
I completed a task which focused on Skills and Interests, this task involved learning about transferable skills, values and how personal interest may influence career choices. After completing the task I also took a quiz to assess my understanding.

My goal was to differentiate between skills, interests and values. Identify the importance of transferable skills and examples of it. The goal was also to see how career decisions can be influenced by personal values. Of course, getting full marks on the quiz was also the goal.

I spent time reading through the whole task and made sure I understood all the concepts and definitions. When completing the quiz I got all the answers correct on the first try which shows I understood the different concepts.

This task broadened the importance of self-awareness in my career development. In future, the concepts I learnt as well as recognizing my interests, values and skills will definitely help me make better career decisions.

### Reflection:
 I completed a Personality Assessment task which explored how different personalities align with specific career paths. I learned about personality career matching based on the Holland Code (RAISEC) model and took a quiz to check my understanding.

My goal was understanding the primary goal of career and personality matching, basically aligning personal traits with suitable jobs. Recognize the six Holland Code personality types and the associated careers. The six personality types include Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising and Conventional. My goal was also to correctly match the different personality types with their work preferences and strengths when doing the quiz.

I read through and reviewed the different personality types and their career connections before taking the quiz. I answered all the questions correctly on the first try which indicates that I was well prepared for the quiz.

This task highlighted the importance of being self-aware in your career planning process. Now that I understand my personality type, it will help me to pursue roles where I most likely am to thrive.

### Reflection:
I completed a task which focused on creating a CV and then took a quiz to test my understanding of the key components needed in a CV.

My goal was to improve the CV I already had and make it better. My goal was also to understand the important components that a CV needs and then apply this to improve my CV by reviewing and making changes to my CV.

I took about 25 to 30 minutes to review my CV and checked which necessary sections were not on my CV and removing any irrelevant information from it. I then evaluated which important information was needed and checked if it was already there, if not, I added it.

Creating a CV, and then answering questions about its purpose, content and structure made me realize that the CV I initially had needed so many upgrades made to it. This task helped me in understanding what was lacking from my CV and how to successfully upgrade it to meet the requirements of an attractive CV.

### Reflection:
My original CV was bad and not tailored for the ICT industry. It had a bit of structure and only listed retail jobs that I had done in the past. My original CV did not have my skills on it as I was just using it to apply for retail jobs.

My goal was to redesign my original CV to have all the relevant skills and projects on it and to also showcase my achievements such as my Diploma in Business Information and Administration as well as my Higher Certificate in Information Communication Technology (ICT).

I reviewed my original CV and removed the irrelevant information and added all necessary information which relates to the ICT industry such as my skills, programming languages, etc.

After making those changes, my CV is much better compared to the original one. I'll keep updating it as I gain new skills and experiences.


## Interview Skills & Mock Interview
### Evidence:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea8b3198-f0ec-420a-b41e-6d85ec91b394)


### Reflection:
I completed an Interview Skills task which covered key concepts such as the Context Action Result (CAR) method and how to answer common interview questions. As someone who has never attended a formal job interview before, this task was valuable preparation. I also did a mock interview which gave me some practical experience but it felt somewhat awkward when I had to "sell myself".

My goal was to understand the purpose of a job interview and learn how to use the CAR method to answer the interview questions. My goal was also to understand why doing research on a company matters before an interview. My ultimate goal was to understand how to apply these skills in an interview despite feeling a bit uncomfortable with self-promotion.

I went over interview best practices which include how to frame answers making use of the CAR method. I also consulted someone who has gone for many interviews before (my mom) on what kind of questions are asked during interviews and how to answer these questions. When I did the mock interview I found it a bit cringe to talk about myself. I struggled with making the delivery sound natural but applied the CAR method to structure my answers better and to sound more authentic and not rehearsed.

Doing the Interview Skills task and Mock Interview video has been an eye opening experience that has highlighted both my strengths and areas for growth. Although i felt uncormfortable at first, these tasks gave me important insight into interview procress.
